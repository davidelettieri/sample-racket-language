# Minimal setup for a racket language with custom syntax

The language implements aritmetic expression with `+`, `-` and grouping `(..)`.

# How to test it

Run in the root directory of the project

```
raco pkg install
```

After that we will be able to use
```
#lang my-lang
```

at the top of our racket files. Please note that `my-lang` is coming from the `info.rkt` file.
